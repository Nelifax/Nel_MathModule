# NelMath

NelMath is mathematical module for python that aimed to long-arythmetics in string notation. It's less powerful than Sage or numpy or something but still available to get some userfriendly features and methods to insearch or experiment manually.

NelMath consists of different modules:
- objects
- functions
- propetries
- tests
- Crypt

Let me indroduce them and their features

## Objects

This module provides different mathematical objects such as Matrix, Vector, Number, Constant, Equation and Random

### Number
Number class provides string-based numbers aimed to long-arythmetics. There are all base number methods such as standart mathematical operations (ex: +, -, /, \*) and so on.
There are also additions such as .sqrt() and .nroot() and
